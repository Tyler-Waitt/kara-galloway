He was attended to by medical personnel on the track for several minutes before being put on a stretcher and into an ambulance.Havnameltdown's death comes on another major race day, in the aftermath of the Kentucky Derby being overshadowed by seven fatalities at Churchill Downs over a span of 10 days.\u201cIt\u2019s the worst feeling. And we grieve. We do grieve when these things happen. There is nothing worse than coming back and the stall is empty,\u201d Baffert said. \u201cHe is a nice horse. He could not have been doing any better. It\u2019s sickening. I am in shock.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nThe favorite at 4-5 for the $200,000 dirt race and breaking from the inside No. 1 post, Havnameltdown was bumped out of the gate by No. 2 Ryvit and broke a step slow but continued running in the 6-furlong race. Havnameltdown and Ryvit, the eventual race winner, were out in front of the pack coming around the second turn.Fans in the crowd at Pimlico Race Course gasped when the horse stumbled before the final turn and tossed Saez. In an incongruous scene, at the same time Saez and Havnameltdown were being looked at, 2Pac\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d continued blaring from infield speakers set up right near where it happened.Meanwhile, on Pimlico\u2019s homestretch, the horse was brought under control by track staff, then led behind some black barriers.\u201cVery unfortunate,\u201d said Tyler Gaffalione, Ryvit\u2019s jockey. \u201cHopefully Luis is OK. We were kind of heads-up, and he just kind of disappeared. I looked back and saw Luis coming off the side.\u201dBaffert pointed out that his horse \u201cwas obviously hit pretty hard coming out of the gate.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know if that contributed to the injury, but we will be fully transparent with those reviewing this terrible accident,\u201d he posted on Twitter.Advertisement\n\nBaffert has horses running on Preakness weekend for the first time in two years after returning from a suspension stemming from 2021 Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit's failed drug test. He was not able to enter horses in the Derby either of the past two years as part of a decision by Churchill Downs. He could not have any in the 2022 Preakness or Belmont because of a 90-day ban in Kentucky respected by Maryland and New York.One of his horses, Arabian Lion, won an earlier race. Baffert is also set to saddle National Treasure in the Preakness.Saez, a Panamanian who turned 31 on Friday, originally was supposed to ride top contender First Mission in the Preakness. But that horse was scratched on the advice of veterinarians because of an issue with his left hind ankle.At the 2019 Kentucky Derby, Saez rode Maximum Security across the line first, but stewards revoked the victory and dropped the colt to 17th for impeding the paths of several horses. Saez then was suspended, accused of causing the interference.Earlier this year, he was aboard Kentucky Derby champion Mage for a runner-up finish at the Florida Derby. At Churchill Downs two weeks ago, Saez\u2019s horse, Tapit Trice, came in seventh in the Derby.Advertisement\n\nHavnameltdown, owned by Michael Pegram, Karl Watson and Paul Weitman, had won four of his six career starts prior to this race. He had most recently finished second in the Saudi Derby in February.\u201cWe never had an issue with him,\" Baffert said. \u201cWe are so careful with all these horses, and it still happens. It is something that is disheartening. I feel so bad for that horse. And I just hope that Luis is OK.\u201d___AP National Writer Howard Fendrich and AP Sports Writer Noah Trister contributed.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsRelatedAnimalsDeathHorse Dies At Churchill Downs, 8th Recent Fatality At Home Of Kentucky DerbyMage Crosses Finish 1st In Kentucky Derby Amid 7th DeathEarly Kentucky Derby Favorite Forte Scratched From Race Go To HomepageSuggest a correctionPopular in the CommunityYou May Like\n\n\n\nTrendingNewsletter Sign UpThe Morning EmailWake up to the day's most important news.Successfully Signed Up!Realness delivered to your inboxBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

She reportedly told investigators that she had found her husband unresponsive in the middle of the night, and earlier this month, she was charged with murder. A statement of probable cause alleged that Kouri Richins had made previous attempts to poison her husband. He once became ill after she made him a drink while on vacation in Greece, it said, and he also became sick after eating a sandwich she made on Valentine\u2019s Day last year.According to court documents, investigators found messages that Kouri Richins sent to an acquaintance about obtaining drugs including fentanyl and \u201csome of the Michael Jackson stuff,\u201d presumably referring to the anesthetic propofol. Prosecutors allege that these substances were used in the attempts to kill her husband.Before his death, Eric Richins reportedly planned to divorce his wife and changed his will to benefit a sibling rather than her. Three months before his death, however, Kouri Richins made herself the sole beneficiary, according to local news outlet KPCW.Advertisement\n\nKouri Richins is pictured in Park City, Utah, on April 12.KPCW.org via APAccording to the AP, Eric Richins met with a divorce attorney and estate planner to cut his wife out of his will in October 2020 after learning about financial moves that Kouri Richins had made without his knowledge.These allegedly included her taking out a $250,000 home equity line of credit, withdrawing $100,000 from his bank account, spending more than $30,000 on his credit cards, and stealing $134,000 from his business.Greg Skordas, a spokesperson for Eric Richins\u2019 family, told CBS affiliate KUTV that despite his suspicions that his wife tried to poison him, the man likely wanted to preserve the relationship for his children.\u201cIt appears Eric may have stayed in a relationship that wasn\u2019t good because he loved his boys, and wanted to keep the family relationship together,\u201d Skordas told KUTV. \u201cMaybe he was hopeful things would change, but his number one concern was for his boys.\u201dAdvertisement\n\nAfter her husband\u2019s death, the widowed mother of three self-published a children\u2019s book about grieving the loss of a loved one. \u201cAre You With Me?\u201d follows the story of a child whose late father continues to watch over them after his death.In an interview with local station ABC4 in April, Kouri Richins said she and her children began writing as a way to navigate life following Eric Richins\u2019 death.The new allegations in the updated charging documents have led her detention hearing to be rescheduled. She is next expected in court on June 12.Subscribe to our true crime newsletter, Suspicious Circumstances, to get the biggest unsolved mysteries, white collar scandals and more delivered straight to your inbox every week.

I didn\u2019t always feel that way. I wanted to be a mom and raise children with my husband, Andrew, and I assumed we would have no problem having kids. Ten years into our marriage, we were living in our first home and felt financially stable and ready, so we started to try to get pregnant purposefully. Advertisement\n\nIt didn\u2019t take us long to get pregnant, but the excitement quickly diminished when I miscarried on Christmas night at eight weeks. That was 13 years ago, but the details remain vivid. We were visiting my in-laws about three hours away from home when cramps woke me up in the middle of the night. I made my way to the bathroom and saw large amounts of blood. I returned to bed, nudged Andrew awake, and told him what was happening. I lay in bed and cried until the morning when I could call my doctor\u2019s emergency number. The office said my best option was to make the trip home and head straight to the hospital. With my head on the car\u2019s center console, tears created a current down my arm while Andrew drove. After a series of blood draws and tests, they performed an internal ultrasound and confirmed what we already knew: There was no heartbeat. My instructions were to rest at home and allow my body to pass the tissue, which it did naturally. I saved it for testing, but unfortunately, the likelihood of finding the why was slim, and the tissue delivered no information. My miscarriage brought feelings of grief, disappointment, emptiness, fear, guilt, and second-guessing. Despite the pain, we decided to keep moving forward and try again. Seven months later, I experienced a second miscarriage. Because I wasn\u2019t as far along as I had been the first time, it was physically less painful, but the emotional scars cut deep. I was grateful only our parents knew I was pregnant a second time. It would have been agonizing to notify many family members and friends of another round of loss. Advertisement\n\nEven though I wanted children, my uncertainty grew. I questioned if I had the emotional stamina to continue purposefully trying to conceive, knowing there was a risk of further miscarriages and loss. I didn\u2019t want to put my body through IVF\u2019s ups and downs; additionally, my OB-GYN said they didn\u2019t investigate the possible causes until after a woman\u2019s third miscarriage. Although we were grieving, life eventually refound its rhythm. We got another puppy and decided that having children would happen if it happened.When my sister-in-law became pregnant with her firstborn, I was genuinely elated for her and her husband while also managing my feelings of sadness and exclusion. Showing up to baby showers and family gatherings was emotionally exhausting. Sometimes I had to escape to the bathroom when my emotions started to overwhelm me. Even though I was excited to become an aunt, it was clear that I had not yet metabolized my grief or fully embraced the fact that we might never be parents.It took me several years to find peace and acceptance with not having children. I allowed myself to stand in the sadness and deal with the raw emotions as they ebbed and flowed. Through the hard work of self-reflection, I overcame feelings of inadequacy and now honestly appreciate and acknowledge my value as a woman without a child. I\u2019m 46 now and never became a mom. But I am a nurturer for my family, dogs, and my closest friends. I have mama bear instincts; mess with any of them, and I\u2019m in the ring, ready to support. My husband and I have grown an abundant and adventurous life we are grateful for and proud of. We have the freedom to live spontaneously and seize opportunities socially and professionally. For example, Andrew was able to accept an exciting job prospect that required moving to a new state and leaving our family and friends behind, one we would likely have declined if we had children. We are also able to indulge in travel and other experiences more frequently. Advertisement\n\nI\u2019ve still felt the stigma that exists for childless women. Women without children are stereotyped as incomplete or \u201cselfish,\u201d or some imply that we\u2019re \u201cmissing out on a critical part of being a woman.\u201d Strangers ask me a lot if we have children. So whenever I am asked the question, I have to read my audience and run through the mental Rolodex of appropriate answers in my head. On our last vacation in St. Lucia, while hiking the Gros Pitons, our female guide asked us if we had kids. We said with a smile, \u201cNo kids \u2014 five wonderful dogs.\u201d She replied: \u201cOh. Just didn\u2019t want any?\u201d While navigating rock boulders and my response, I said, \u201cWe just weren\u2019t blessed with them.\u201dRecently, a male pedicurist also asked me if I had kids, and when I said no, he proceeded to pry, similarly asking, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t want them?\u201d This time, I boldly replied, \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable having this conversation; it is extremely personal.\u201d Answering the question used to feel awkward and deflating. Now, I have agency over my response and feel comfortable setting a boundary. But I believe asking women if they have children (and worse, why not?) should be off-limits. It\u2019s really no one\u2019s business. Advertisement\n\nAsking women about their parental status and the reasons behind it is extremely invasive. While I have zero regrets about our choice to be child-free, answering the question makes me feel like motherhood is the only defining aspect of being a woman. Instead of asking a stranger whose story you don\u2019t know if they have kids, why not initiate a conversation about their interests, hobbies or personal experiences? \u201cWhat do you do for fun?\u201d \u201cWhat is your favorite genre of music?\u201d or \u201cHow did you grow passionate about a hobby you enjoy?\u201dSometimes, I feel a little sentimental watching Andrew interact with our nephew and two nieces because I know we would have been extraordinary parents. That is normal. I adore children, love being around their carefree and adventurous spirits, and try to support the moms in my life as a cheerleader, an ear and a helping hand. I\u2019ve changed diapers, fed bottles, held hands to cross the street, and no longer felt sad afterward. My healing process was long but simple. I wholly accepted the gifts I have; to provide love, leadership, mentoring, connection, and care to others, especially my family and friends with and without children and the animals that I care for. I don\u2019t have any less love in my life because I didn\u2019t experience motherhood, and I have learned to love myself along the way.

They were caught several months later in raids in Berlin.In January, there was a plea bargain between the defense, prosecution and court after most of the stolen jewels were returned.Police outside the Green Vault Museum in Dresden, Germany, following the break-in.Jens Schlueter via Getty ImagesThe plea bargain had been agreed to by four defendants, who subsequently admitted their involvement in the crime through their lawyers. The fifth defendant also confessed, but only to the procurement of objects such as the axes used to make holes in the museum display case, dpa reported.The state of Saxony, where Dresden is located, had claimed damages of almost 89 million euros in court \u2014 for the pieces that were returned damaged, for those still missing and for repairs to the destroyed display cases and the museum building.Advertisement\n\nThe Green Vault is one of the world\u2019s oldest museums.

Having worked on search and search ads for over a decade, we sincerely believed that there was space for a model of search that put user and not advertiser interests first\u2014a private, ads-free experience.Building search engines is hard. It is even harder to do with a tiny team of 50 people who are up against entrenched organizations with endless resources. We overcame these obstacles and built a search stack from the ground up, running a crawl that fetched petabytes of information from the web and used that to power an independent search stack.In early 2022, the upcoming impact of generative AI and LLMs became clear to us. We embarked on an ambitious effort to seamlessly blend LLMs into our search stack. We rallied the Neeva team around the vision to create an answer engine. We are proud of being the first search engine to provide cited, real-time AI answers to a majority of queries early this year.But throughout this journey, we\u2019ve discovered that it is one thing to build a search engine, and an entirely different thing to convince regular users of the need to switch to a better choice. From the unnecessary friction required to change default search settings, to the challenges in helping people understand the difference between a search engine and a browser, acquiring users has been really hard. Contrary to popular belief, convincing users to pay for a better experience was actually a less difficult problem compared to getting them to try a new search engine in the first place.These headwinds, combined with the different economic environment, have made it clear that there is no longer a path towards creating a sustainable business in consumer search. As a result, over the next few weeks, we will be shutting down neeva.com and our consumer search product, and shifting to a new area of focus.If you have a paid subscription to Neeva Premium, you will receive a refund for the unused portion of your subscription. We have more information for you in our FAQ. As part of the shutdown, we are deleting all user data. Apple iOS subscribers, please go to https://reportaproblem.apple.com/ to request your refund as soon as possible.Neeva has a passionate community of customers and users who have supported us over the past few years. They have tried out early previews of our features, given us thoughtful feedback, and given us the love and encouragement that every young team needs. We are truly grateful to our community, and we are truly sorry that we aren\u2019t able to continue to provide the search engine that you want and deserve.What\u2019s next for NeevaOver the past year, we\u2019ve seen the clear, pressing need to use LLMs effectively, inexpensively, safely, and responsibly. Many of the techniques we have pioneered with small models, size reduction, latency reduction, and inexpensive deployment are the elements that enterprises really want, and need, today. We are actively exploring how we can apply our search and LLM expertise in these settings, and we will provide updates on the future of our work and our team in the next few weeks.We want to thank the Neeva team for the time, effort and dedication to build Neeva. It has been an honor and privilege to take on this challenge with all of you and we could not have chosen a better set of friends and colleagues to be on this journey.Related content from NeevaNeeva Partners with Dashlane for a more Secure Online Experience Neeva and Botify Partner to Help You Discover Fresh, Relevant ContentIntroducing Neeva Free Basic and Neeva Premium Bringing Transparency to Web3: Neeva.xyz, the Web3 Search EngineInstant Reddit Summaries with Neeva AINeeva launches in Spain to rival Google Search with tracking free, bias free, AI Powered search Share this: HomeFeaturesAboutBlogPressCommunityLearnOur ProductsShopTermsPrivacyCookiesBill of RightsDMCANeeva Web CrawlerNeeva.xyzContact\u00a9 2023 Neeva Inc",

I\u2019m not telling you anything.\u201cAfter careful consideration, we do not believe the Committee has the authority to investigate Mr. Crow\u2019s personal friendship with Justice Clarence Thomas,\u201d reads a letter from Crow\u2019s lawyer, Michael Bopp of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. Advertisement\n\n\u201cMost importantly, Congress does not have the constitutional power to impose ethics rules and standards on the Supreme Court,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cDoing so would exceed Congress\u2019s Article I authority and violate basic separation of powers principles. That precludes the Committee from pursuing an investigation in support of such legislation.\u201dHere\u2019s a copy of Crow\u2019s letter, first obtained by HuffPost:Democrats on the Senate committee, led by Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), demanded earlier this month that Crow provide them with a list of all gifts in excess of $415 that he has given to Supreme Court justices. Their letter came in response to ProPublica\u2019s bombshell report last month that Thomas has been accepting luxury trips and gifts from Crow virtually every year for more than two decades without disclosing them.Crow also purchased Thomas\u2019 ancestral home from the justice, renovated it, and now reportedly allows Thomas\u2019 mother to live there rent-free. In addition, Crow paid private school tuition for Thomas\u2019 grandnephew, whom Thomas treated as his adopted son. Thomas failed to disclose both the sale of his family\u2019s home and his adopted son\u2019s covered tuition.Advertisement\n\nAmid all of this, Crow has had business interests before the court.In a Tuesday statement, Durbin lambasted the GOP megadonor\u2019s response to the committee, calling it \u201cuntenable\u201d and saying it does not \u201cprovide a credible justification\u201d for Crow\u2019s failure to respond to senators\u2019 written questions.\u201cThe gifts and access to Justices that these companies provided are highly relevant to the Committee\u2019s legislative efforts on ethics reform,\u201d Durbin said.The Illinois senator also rejected Crow\u2019s claim that Congress lacks the authority to pass ethics legislation that applies to Supreme Court justices, and mocked the idea that Crow doesn\u2019t need to provide information to the panel because it\u2019s a separation-of-powers issue.\u201cMr. Crow does not work, and has never worked, for the Supreme Court,\u201d said Durbin.He added: \u201cThe Committee will respond more fully to this letter in short order, and will continue to seek a substantive response to our information requests in order to craft and advance the targeted ethics legislation needed to help restore trust in the Supreme Court.\u201dSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has gotten decades of luxury gifts and travel for free from conservative billionaire Harlan Crow, who has had business interests before the court. But the court has no code of ethics, so never mind, it's all fine!via Associated PressAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of all this is the glaring problem of the Supreme Court not having an enforceable code of ethics. Indeed, it has never had one, unlike every other federal court in the country. Senate Democrats have introduced legislation to give the court a code of ethics, but Republicans have almost entirely rejected the idea of doing anything, saying it\u2019s on the court to govern itself.In a sign of how politicized the issue remains in the Senate, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) on Tuesday led Republicans on the judiciary committee in a letter to Durbin, criticizing his efforts to compel Crow to provide more details to the panel about gifts he\u2019s given to Thomas.\u201cYour requests appear misaligned and political,\u201d the GOP senators wrote. \u201cFurther, they only target conservative members of the Supreme Court. To start, your letters claim that you believe \u2018private access\u2019 to justices \u2015 seemingly when justices socialize with anyone not on the Court \u2015 \u2018creates an appearance of undue influence that undermines the public\u2019s trust in the Court\u2019s impartiality.\u2019 But judges, justices, politicians, and other public figures engage with friends in private settings every day \u2015 just as anyone else.\u201dKennedy\u2019s letter concludes: \u201cWe urge you to withdraw your May 8th letters to Mr. Crow and his entities and to refocus the Judiciary Committee\u2019s efforts on legitimate inquiries.\u201dAccountable.US, a nonpartisan watchdog group focused on government corruption, maintains that the Supreme Court is highly overdue for a code of ethics, regardless of whether Congress or the court puts it in place.Advertisement\n\n\u201cIt was Justice Thomas\u2019s decades-long improper financial relationship with billionaire benefactor Harlan Crow that sparked the Supreme Court corruption crisis, which has now reached a fever pitch,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Kyle Herrig. \u201cChief Justice Roberts has deflected his responsibility to clean up his Court, forcing Congress to step in. Whether by Roberts or Congress, we need urgent reform to restore credibility and integrity to our Court.\u201dRelatedSupreme CourtClarence ThomasDick Durbinharlan crowSen.

Designs by Abprallen, a London-based company that designs and sells occult- and satanic-themed LGBTQ clothing and accessories, have also created backlash.The Pride merchandise has been on sale since early May. Pride month is held in June.Target confirmed that it has moved its Pride merchandise from the front of the stores to the back in some Southern stores after confrontations and backlash from shoppers in those areas. Target\u2019s Pride month collection has also been the subject of several misleading videos in recent weeks, with social media users falsely claiming the retailer is selling \u201ctuck-friendly\u201d bathing suits designed for kids or in kids\u2019 sizes.The moves come as beer brand Bud Light is still grappling with a backlash from customers angered by its attempt to broaden its customer base by partnering with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Bud Light's parent company said it will triple its marketing spending in the U.S. this summer as it tries to restore sales it lost after the brand partnered with the transgender influencer.Advertisement\n\nTarget and other retailers including Walmart and H&M have been expanding their LGBTQ displays to celebrate Pride month for roughly a decade. This year transgender issues \u2014 including gender-affirming health care and participation in sports \u2014 have been a divisive topic in state legislatures and the backlash has turned hostile.______Follow Anne D\u2019Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzioRelatedLGBTQlondontranstargetprideNation's LGBTQ Rights Group Issues Travel Advisory For Florida\u2018Trans Youth Prom\u2019 Fosters Space For Transgender Joy And CommunityAnother Florida Pride Event Canceled As Other Organizers Dig Their Heels In Go To Homepage\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.\n\nSuggest a correctionPopular in the CommunityYou May Like\n\n\n\nTrendingNewsletter Sign UpPoliticsHuffPost's top politics stories, straight to your inbox.Successfully Signed Up!Realness delivered to your inboxBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.
